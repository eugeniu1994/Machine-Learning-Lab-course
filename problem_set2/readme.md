Notes:
--> Assignment 1: - Now the initial centroids are initialized at random data points from X.
                  - Loss value calculated according to the handbook (P.21)
		  - Handle possible empty clusters: if a cluster is empty, the centroid is reinitialized at some  
		    random data point from X.
